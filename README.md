# Object-Detection-for-Erasers
Object Detection by YOLO-v5
- TODO: add info about project environment (both `conda` and `pip`)
- Update (7.29): add Yolo-v5 model and some strange eraser images
  - Pay attention to `eraser.yaml`, `train.py` and `detect.py` (I made modifications in these three files)
- Update (7.28): add all files in this project except Yolo-v5 model
